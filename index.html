            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The spirit of giving<br /></li>
                <p>Under Ratan Tata's leadership,65% of Tata Group's profits were directed to charitable
                    causes,supporting education, healthcare, scientific research, and countless other initiatives
                    designed to improve lives.</p>
                <li>A leader who stood apart</li>
                <p>Ratan Tata was a leader who stood apart in a world often focused on personal gain. As the chairman of
                    Tata Group, one of the world's largest and most respected companies, he never pursued personal
                    wealth. </p>
                <li>Compassion in crisis</li>
                <p>This spirit of compassion and service was most evident in times of crisis. After the 2008 Mumbai
                    terror attacks, which struck the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Tata made sure that all affected employees
                    and guests received care and support. </p>
                <p> And during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tata Steel announced that the families of employees who died from
                    the virus would continue to receive their salaries and benefits until the worker would have turned
                    60. These acts of kindness exemplify Tata's commitment to putting people first, no matter the
                    circumstances.</p>
                <li>A legacy built on service</li>
                <p>Ratan Tata may not have accumulated great personal wealth during his lifetime, but today, he is
                    mourned by a billion people. His legacy teaches us that true success is not about how much we
                    acquire but about how much we give. He showed us that leadership is defined not by what we gain but
                    by how we serve. </p>
            </ul>
